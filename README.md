Node Api with authentication technique using json web token(i.e. JWT).
In JWT authentication technique is token based. So for logout we don't need rest end point implementation.
This needs to handle at client side. If user is not logging out then token will expire after expire timeout time.

Code base contains Rest end points. So for testing purpose Postman needs to be installed.
Postman can be installed form chrome store . Url: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions

Following steps needs to be followed:
1) 2 folder named uploads and post-image needs to be created in app directory.
2)npm install
3)npm start
